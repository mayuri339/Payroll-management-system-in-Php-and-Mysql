# Payroll-management-system-in-Php-and-Mysql
The data that is stored in a Payroll management system written in PHP and MySQL is stored in an easy-to-access database. It should be noted that the payroll management system can not only maintain and update employee information, but it can also generate the outputs that are required, such as paychecks and government reports. Each week, data from the current pay period is entered and verified in the payroll management system.  Using this data, the employee master file is updated with appropriate additions, changes, and deletions based on the information contained in this source. Employees of the company are able to manage their payroll with overtime pay, bonuses, deductions, and employee attendance by utilizing the PHP payroll management system. Additionally, the payroll system PHP MySQL source code allows the user to insert employee records and display all available information, such as the employee's name, contact information, department, type, and so on. As part of the payroll management system, there are two categories in the project: the admin panel and the employee panel. The web application allows admins to access employee information as well as payroll details for their employees.  Admins must set employee pay heads and attach earnings and deductions with their respective amounts in order to maintain their payroll. Once the payroll process has been completed, he/she will be able to proceed with the next step. In order for the user to select a salary month, first he or she must select a salary month. As a result of using the payroll management system in PHP and MySQL, a table containing information about employees, such as their salaries, overtime, and deductions, is displayed in the payroll management system. In addition to all these items, the user is able to get his/her net salary payable amounts with all these items combined for him/her. The employee can view his/her pay slip after it has been generated by logging into his/her account. Additionally, the administrator can add holiday information, date, and view each employee's total working hours. Last but not least, the administrator is responsible for managing all requests for leave by accepting or rejecting them according to their preferences. When it comes to the payroll management system in PHP, administrators can only manage employee records in an overview, while managers have full control over the overall process. A manager has access to information about a company's employees and its business. Using this system, they can prepare pay slips and payments for specific employees in advance. Messages can also be exchanged between members of the management and others. Once you have selected an employee from the payroll list to be entered, you will need to enter their loan amount, their absence days, their allowances, and their bonuses.
